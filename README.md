# Espacializadores

This project was made 4 my research in multichannel spacialization during my graduation. It contains [PureData](puredata.org) patchs that spatialize any audio sources (as .wav, .aif) in surround systems like 5.1. Additionally, I add a special version of 10 channels.

The algorithms of spacialization (panoramization's curves) was made by Prof. Dr. J.A. Mannis at Art's Institute at Unicamp/Brazil (IA/Unicamp), and follow some principles of hearing, like natural perception of localization and acoustic shadows. These algorithms do not follow 5.1 surround system made by Dolby Surround

# TODO

- suport to mp3 and ogg files
- a graphical panner, better to gesture spacialization
